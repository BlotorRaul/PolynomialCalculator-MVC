# Project Description: Polynomial Calculator with MVC Architecture

## Overview:
The "Polynomial Calculator" project is a Java application that utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to perform mathematical operations on polynomials. This application provides functionalities for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration of polynomials.

## Key Features:
- **MVC Architecture:** The project is structured according to the Model-View-Controller architecture, which separates the business logic (Model), user interface (View), and control logic (Controller). This structure facilitates the management and extension of the application.
- **Advanced Mathematical Operations:** The application supports a variety of mathematical operations on polynomials, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration. These functionalities are implemented efficiently and accurately, providing correct results.
- **Regex Parsing:** To allow users to input polynomials as strings, the application uses regular expressions (Regex) to parse and validate input. This ensures a more intuitive and flexible interaction with the user.
- **Unit Testing with JUnit:** The application's functionalities are thoroughly tested using JUnit, a unit testing framework for Java. Unit tests verify the correctness of mathematical operations and other essential functionalities, ensuring code quality and reliability.
- **Graphical User Interface with Swing:** The user interface is implemented using Java Swing, providing a pleasant and intuitive graphical experience. Users can easily interact with the application and visualize the results of mathematical operations in a user-friendly manner.
- **Efficient Data Structure with TreeMap:** Polynomial monomials are stored in a TreeMap data structure, which ensures an ordered and efficient organization of data. This facilitates fast mathematical operations and access to stored elements.

## Conclusion:
The "Polynomial Calculator" project represents a robust and efficient implementation of mathematical operations on polynomials, using the MVC architecture and Java technologies such as Swing, JUnit, and regular expressions. With advanced functionalities, rigorous unit testing, and a user-friendly graphical interface, this application offers a comprehensive and easy-to-use solution for working with polynomials in Java.
